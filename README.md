## Demo
For as long as humans have participated in the act of communication, concealing information in those communicative mediums or concealing any traces of communication has manifested into an art of its own. An important technique used to conceal any traces of communication called steganography has been used in many domains including government level communication and encoding harmful media in innocuous media such as in phishing emails. Our work aims to crack a popular steganography algorithm and running our code will highlight exactly how to do that. 

We will have one demo file, ```cycle_gan.ipynb``` to demonstrate quick and simple examples of our results. The notebook will highlight the capabilities of our Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) algorithm to crack the Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography technique.

Our demo uses Jupyter Notebook, so the most basic steps needed to run our code is:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install)
2. Open ```cycle_gan.ipynb```

Below are more detailed instructions on how to work with our code including working with our packages, working with our datasets, manipulate our network, tuning hyper-parameters, and saving results. There is much more to be explored once you understand how to base CycleGAN algorithm works!
