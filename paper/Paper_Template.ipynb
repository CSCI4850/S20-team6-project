    "When you have information that could possibly harm you or others do you leave it out in the open or keep it hidden? And if you were to hide it, would you be worried that someone could find it? Well, what if there was a way to hide information that even if they found it, they could not use it? There is a way and it is how cryptography came to be. Cryptography is the art of writing or solving codes. This means we can use it to encode a message that you would want to give to someone without anyone else discovering it. For example, if a person were to encode “Are you going to the park?” and give it to the recipient who has the decoder they could see the secret message. However, if said message were to get intercepted, that individual would be unable to crack the code to find out the message. Through these situations were the user has no way to decode the message, steganography was born. Steganography is the science of hiding a secret message within an ordinary message. This gives the individual a way to attempt to recognize the encoded information and decrypt it. This reveals that were there is cryptography, there will always be people using steganography to try to decode the encoded information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the use of cryptography, stenography is very difficult to crack because without knowing how the information was encoded the information will be lost to you. This makes stenography an important part of both the cybersecurity and malware worlds. For cybersecurity, many government agencies use stenography because it allows one the ability to send hidden data in an image while hiding the very existence of the information itself. (Seethalakshmi).\n",
    "\n",
    "This very way of hiding data from prying eyes is the exact way individuals use steganography to create malware to steal information. These people will often do this in the form of images or links. Something that appears harmless but can-do major damage. For example, this type of stenography can be regularly seen in phishing emails that contain an image or link that when clicked on releases a virus into the computer and steals information. \n",
    "This experiment looks at using Stenography similar to the methods mentioned before to take an image and hide it inside another. In order to interpret the images we are processing and decode the bits hidden inside them, we will be using Cycle GANs. GANs, Generative Adversarial Networks, are a method for deep learning development to help synthesize data. They are widely used in image generation and will help in deciphering our data. This strategy of deciphering data in this manner was originally introduced in a paper by Ian Goodfellow with his fellow researches at the University of Montreal in 2014. (Per Welander)\n",
    "\n",
    "This network will use the significant bit method to hide an image inside of another image, and Cycle GANs to recognize the hidden image. For this, we will have two sets of photos. One set will contain the images to hide, and the second set will contain images to hide the requested photo in. In order to do this the two parts of our Cycle GAN, the discriminator, and the generator, must work together to recognize real verses generated images. Both the discriminator and the generator are part of a U-net architecture. To accomplish this, the generator will take the most significant bits from photos in the first set and attempt to hide the image inside an image from the second set. The Discriminator will then take the generators output and photos from the second set in order to determine the likelihood that it is not a generated image. In doing so, it is attempting to crack the hiding algorithm that was used to place the hidden image inside of its parent image. The likelihood information gained from the discriminator is calculated as the loss of the network and is used to determine how accurate it is at hiding and recognizing hidden images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to effectively determine the loss from the images, we will be using a system called pix2pix that will allow us to measure the difference between a real and generated image. Pix2pix is a non-parametric texture model for translating an image to another image. This makes it very useful to our Cycle GANs by allowing easy translation between images and making it possible to generate an image like the input image. (R. Meng)\n",
    "\n",
    "While we are using pix2pix to help determine the loss of generated vs real images, we are also using bayesian optimization. Which is defined as a methodology to optimize functions with expensive evaluations. In using this, we can improve the output of our image processing to make more accurate encoded pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper discusses the value and methodology of hiding images inside of another and is worth every consideration. It is worth consideration because of its possibility. If our model can effectively recognize a generated image it can have major implications for cybersecurity. One of the main problems in cybersecurity are phishing emails that contain an image or link that releases a virus to steal information. Our model could give the ability to scan phishing material and determine whether the image is generated and mark it as phishing content. This would prevent thousands of potential breaches to sensitive information as well as becoming a major step forward in cryptography. Cryptography would have its boundaries pushed because this method for detecting encrypted information has not been accomplished effectively. Cryptography remains an important aspect in the battle against others who wish to steal important information, and our model can help protect that information.\n",
