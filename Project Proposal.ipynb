    "        In Cryptography, Ciphers are algorithms that perform some kind of encryption on data. The point of Ciphers is to encode information, then the same kind of Cipher would be used to decode the information. Ciphers are known to be notoriously hard to crack, because to be able to glean an encoded message, you would have to create an algorithm that performs the original encryption process but in reverse."
