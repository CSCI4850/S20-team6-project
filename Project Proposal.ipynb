    "Steganography (covered or concealed writing) is the practice of hiding information such as files, messages, images, and videos within other files, messages, images, and videos. The main attraction of Steganography is the ability to hide information without drawing attention to itself (unlike most Ciphers which are clearly Ciphers) [1]. There are two-layer to this type of concealment, hiding the fact that a message is being sent and the message itself. The change in the images is so subtle that someone who is not looking for the changes will not notice anything. "

    "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks (Generator and Discriminator), pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. The synthetic data is drawn from the same distribution as the real data [2]. They are used widely in image generation, video generation, and voice generation. Some examples of their useses include style transfer and deepfakes. "
