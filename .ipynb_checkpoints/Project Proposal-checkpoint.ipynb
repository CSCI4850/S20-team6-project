    "        Steganography (covered or concealed writing) is the practice of hiding information such as files, messages, images, and videos within other files, messages, images, and videos. The main attraction of Steganography is the ability to hide information without drawing attention to itself (unlike most Ciphers which are clearly Ciphers). There are two-layer to this type of concealment, hiding the fact that a message is being sent and the message itself. The change in the images is so subtle that someone who is not looking for the changes will not notice anything. "

    "         The image above shows an example of hiding an image within another image while not being very obvious. With the use of some Steganography algorithm, the image of the cat is hidden in the cover image while maintaining its original look. From this example, it is seen that the changes in the image are so subtle, that the only way to notice the change is to actively search for it. "

    "        Our goal is to try to crack Steganography algorithms. By that, we want to be able to look at an image that contains hidden information and extract it. For the purpose of this project, the information hidden within an image will be text. So our model will be able to look at the images with hidden information and extract it. With the learned distribution (of the Steganography algorithm), it will be able to decode the information hidden in the image. "
